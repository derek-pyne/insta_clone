# Insta Clone
## Project Outline
Instagram advertising falls into three big buckets:
1. Directly from the Facebook Ad Manager. 
These are the normal ads that show up in your feed. 
You can use Facebooks targeting/segmentation tools to target your niche.
2. Product Placement with Influencers. 
Brands can directly reach out to influencers and negotiate specific 
partnership deals with them. This requires a large influencer with a 
significant personal brand.
3. Purchased posts.
For smaller influencers, companies can directly reach out to them
and purchase a post on their account for a certain amount of time.
This post shows up just like any other post that the influencer makes 
(ie. it is not tagged as an ad). The influencer then takes down the post
after the negotiated time period has expired. 

This project looks to automate the third category.

Some of the influencers in this category are curated/reposting content.
This presents and opportunity to automate since this content is not
tied to any specific person/brand (ie. it wouldn't look weird posted
 by someone else).
 
 ### Automation Approach
 We will create meta accounts that are aggregates of these aggregating 
 accounts.

## Project Plan
- Tool to periodically scrap posts from aggregating influencers
- Tool to build a feed out of these scraped posts
- Ability to upload this curated feed to hootsuite to go in account
